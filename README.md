# This is Genesis UI
- Frontend Design Prototype is in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/GDGvVKokVwKynybHWPbjE6/Untitled?node-id=5%3A3&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1) and mind chart in [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e5da1084-1e8c-41da-809b-eff2d67a8e6f/edit?invitationId=inv_bb2468bf-30ef-4c63-a4b9-b37ea4e4a91d&referringApp=slack&page=0_0#)
- Frontend will be using HTML CSS/SCSS and React
- Backend will be implement using [Golang](https://golang.org/) with [Gin Gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

# Four Phases for The Genesis UI

## Phase 1: Informational Interface.
The informational Interface will contains three web pages:
- [ ] A login page for developers to login using their credentials.
- [ ] A home page for showing most recent viewed deployment details, a sandwich menu for account information accessing, and navigation bar for accessing list of deployments with filter.
- [ ] A Deployment page for hosting all information (company, region, infrastructure and etc)

### Current focus:
- [ ] Improving prototype based on needs.
- [ ] Getting familiar with Golang and Gin Gonic for backend.
- [ ] Working on implementing login page and its functionality.

## Phase 2: Compare Deployment.

## Phase 3: Functional Interface.

## Phase 4: Health Monitoring.
